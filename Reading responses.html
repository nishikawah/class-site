    <div class="align"><h1>Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House...</h1><br><p>"My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: theyâ€™re both subject and object at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be." This quote is my favorite part of this reading and made me really excited taking this class. When I was little, I thouht a website was made by a machine and I never imagined there is a person behind the codes. So, for me, a website was a tool that aliens provided for humans for a better living.</p></div>
      <div class="align"><h1>Callum Copley, New Document 1</h1><br><p>I was very confused to where I was supposed to be reading. Also, these notification effects really bothered me and I had to close the website many times. Other than those, I think it was very interesting to see the interactions between these fictious characters.</p></div>
        <div class="align"><h1>Frank Chimero, The Good Room</h1><br><p>It was a little hard for me to understand this reading but I do agree with his statement about the library. Library is one of my favorite place to just wonder around whenever I need a break from working. </p></div>
